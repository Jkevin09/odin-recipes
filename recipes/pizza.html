    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Yeast</h4>
            <p>Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Sugar</h4>
            <p>To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. <br>
                The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Bread Fluor</h4>
            <p>Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. <br>
                This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Olive Oil</h4>
            <p>Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Salt</h4>
            <p>A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan./p>

    </ol>
    <ol>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth.<br>
            You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</p>
    </ol>
